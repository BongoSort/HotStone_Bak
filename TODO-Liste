BACKLOG:

Findus should not be allowed to use Peddersens heropower when it is Peddersens turn (and vice-versa). Check in a later iteration.
getOwner in Hero class needs to be tested. Possibly superduper obvious test, maybe redundant?.
A few tests from the testList that have to wait for a later iteration of HotStone.
In future branches, we will use the correct namingscheme ( i.e. iteration2 and so on ), as proposed by Henrik BÃ¦rbak Christensen.
